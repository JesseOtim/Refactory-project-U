          <h2>Our History</h2>
          <p>
            The open field, the livestock, the pasture and trees represent the
            vision of massaja division farm (ufarm), established in January
            2023. Ufarm is an embodiment of freedom which is the amalgamation
            (uniting) of several farms in uganda under one umbrella. This idea
            was generated after immense research into the agricultural sector by
            a few individuals who discovered that a surprisingly huge number of
            farmers in the country or people who were involved in agriculture
            found it difficult to find reliable market for their products.
            Different products have different seasons and that had caused a lot
            of retreat from agriculture by many individuals. Then an idea spark in the middle of the storm, Massaja farm envisioned a society where each and every one gets their fair share of natures gift. Horticulture, Dairy, Produce and Poultry products all at your fingertips, at your disposal. An idea for an online platform was born to ease interaction between farmers and customers, products and their respective markets to enable easy acquisition of quality products for the consumers and income for the farmers.

            <!-- Cash crops and The
            split rail fence, wheat field, rooting pigs, and log house represent
            a four-year-old farm, established when Iowa became a state in 1846.
            The farm site is in transition between subsistence agriculture
            (producing enough for the family to survive) and becoming a
            profit-making farm. Most farms in 1850 averaged 160 acres in size,
            with farmers cultivating anywhere from 25 to 40 acres. Corn, wheat,
            and potatoes were the three major crops in 1850. Most farmers used
            their corn crop to feed the pigs that were then sold for profit.
            Wheat and hogs were cash crops for farmers, and potatoes were a
            staple with nearly every meal and lasted throughout the winter.
            Until pioneer families earned enough money to purchase modern 1850
            technology, they relied on older farming methods. For example, women
            prepared food over an open fire even though wood-burning cookstoves
            were available. The majority of people who settled in Iowa in the
            1840s and 1850s came from the Eastern United States, and were eager
            to build a multi-room dwelling like they had lived in before coming
            west. Log houses were temporary structures that the pioneers
            improved or replaced once the farm was established. Pioneer families
            relied on poultry for three major purposes: meat, eggs, and money.
            Most pioneers who raised pigs built a smokehouse to help preserve
            the pork. In 1850, barns were of less significance to the farm than
            in later years. Pioneers used barns to store tools and some crops,
            rather than to house animals. The big barns that are associated with
            modern farms were not built in Iowa until the 1870s. -->
